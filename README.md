#### ATM client/RESTful asynchronous web server/client example written in C++.

##### Client:

A very simple ATM client built on Qt.  Source is located in the "Client
project/" directory.

The client forward some requests to the web server and reacts to the responses.
I had no chance to learn MFC from zero in 3 days so I chose Qt which I used 16
years ago last time (signal-slot still the same as it was in Qt 2 :) ).
.cardinfo must be copied to the userâ€™s home folder.  .cardinfo is a JSon config
file which contains some basic config values for a card. "Url":
"http://192.168.0.101/atm/" line must contain the address of the server with /
atm/ suffix which is mandatory (at both sides).  I developed the client on Mac.
Unfortunately I could not compile casablanca on Mac (although it should work by
the docs) so I could not use it on the client side.

##### Server:

Win64 C++ RESTful web service to accept and execute bankcard operation requests.
Source is located in the "Server project/" directory.

ATMWebService.exe: The server exe on a windows machine is a pure windows command
line app. On Windows 10 it must be run with admin rights as it accepts
connections from any network address on port
80. I also had to turn off firewall. It generates the test data from the code,
so no config file for it. Compiled into
%PROJECTS%\ATMWebService\x64\[Debug|Release]\ATMWebService.exe In VS 2015 I
used cpprest-..desktop-..140 nu package which is casablanca 2.6.

##### Used Design Patterns:
###### Server:
![alt text](server-uml.png "UML")
- Singleton
- Factory method
- Strategy
- Web version of Model-View-Controller

###### Client:
![alt text](client-uml.png "UML")
- Model-View-Controller (ATMDialog is the main Controller and also the main
  view, the subviews are controlled from this class.
- 2 different model classes are used (CardModel for card info and NetworkModel
  for network/http communication). The ATMDialog also connects these two models
as they are independent from each other.
- Delegate Pattern. It is the Mac style delegate pattern (observer pattern
  restricted to one observer object). NetworkModel notifies its delegate via the
NetworkDelegate interface (@protocol in ObjC). ATMDialog implements this
protocol to be able to handle finished events.
